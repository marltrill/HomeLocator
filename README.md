<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

HomeLocator was designed and built by Alexander Boest-Petersen, Christina Elmegaard-Fessel, Kristoffer Knudsen-Host, and Marcia Trillo studying at Aalborg University Copenhagen for the Spring 2021 semester in the Survey \& Planning and Land Management Masters Program from February 2021 to June 2021. Currently, HomeLocator is built with the focus of find areas within the country of Denmark, located in Northern Europe. Some areas may be missing grids due to data storage constraints of freely available services.

HomeLocator incorporates knowledge and practices garnered from GI Technology, Geovisualisation, and Spatial Planning courses in an attempt to develop a decision support system to aid prospective home owners locate suitable areas for purchasing their future homes and/or property.
